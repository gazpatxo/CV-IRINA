# Information Architecture
The website organizes information in a clear, logical way that would be useful for a hiring manager assessing my skills and experience. Each section flows naturally, starting with an **About Me** section that introduces my background, personality, and core values as a designer. **Working Experience** follows, providing a snapshot of my past roles, with highlights of key responsibilities and accomplishments. This section is designed to give a hiring manager a quick yet comprehensive view of my hands-on experience. Next, **Skills** offers a succinct list of tools and techniques I’m proficient in, allowing easy evaluation of my technical capabilities. **Interesting Facts** adds a personal touch, showcasing unique hobbies and talents that set me apart. Finally, **Contact Me** includes all necessary details for easy outreach. This architecture not only demonstrates my skills but also gives insight into who I am as a creative professional.

# Visual Design
For the visual design of my website, I focused on achieving a professional yet inviting look to appeal to potential employers. The color scheme is minimalist, using neutral tones to keep the content clean and uncluttered, ensuring that my work and experience remain the focal points. Typography was chosen with readability in mind, using a modern, sans-serif font that conveys professionalism while being easy on the eyes. I strategically placed images to break up the text and add visual interest, displaying some of my work samples in an organized way that highlights my creative skills without overwhelming the viewer. Spacing and white space are used throughout the site to prevent any sense of clutter, making it easy for a hiring manager to navigate quickly. Interactive elements, such as clickable project links, provide deeper engagement and allow them to explore my work further. This approach aims to create a positive first impression, balancing professionalism with an approachable design style that reflects my personal brand as a designer.
